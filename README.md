# Max-Flow-Problem
Maximum flow problems find a feasible flow through a single-source (S), single-sink (T) flow  network that is maximum. This problem is useful for solving complex network flow problems  such as the circulation problem.

Flow in the network has the following restrictions:
• Every link of the network has an individual capacity which is the maximum flow that link
allows.
• Input flow must match to output flow for each node in the graph, except the source and 
sink node.
• Flow out from source node must match with the flow in to sink node.
• Flow from each edge should not exceed the capacity of that node. 
Your task: Design and implement an efficient algorithm to find the maximum flow possible from 
source (S) vertex to sink (T) vertex.
